Alive is an organization based under DuckyHQ. Therefore Alive uses all of the MorphUI design guidelines for user interfaces. Alive introduces more types of design to DuckyHQ, such as phyisical products used for running cities, paper manual design, and more. The design guidelines for those will be documented soon, probably at [duckyhq.com/design/docs](https://duckyhq.com/design/docs).
