Alive City is a futuristic, realistic, detailed, and really documented Minecraft city. Big plans and layouts, all the way to small details such as traffic light controllers will all be documented here. We want to design beautiful products and UI for usually very obscure items.

The city will be pedestrian focused, and we'll be working to make cars less of a focus in your life.

# Current Stage

We are currently in the planning stage, right now this is a side-project. We are currently working on the map, and we want it to be good, since it's the base of the entire city. Then we'll design roads, components, buildings, and start focussing on documentation and details.

# Plans

- Futuristic pedestrian focused city
- Downtown
- Affordable residential
- Fusion reactor
- Office parks (DuckyHQ Labs, Slate, Bibleio, etc.)
- Stadium
- Alive Drum & Bugle Corp

# Contributing

Right now, this isn't a public project, neither is there a public Minecraft server. If people display interest in contributing, such as in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/UWCJbNVrKh), we'll consider making this project public. Again, right now this is a side project for us, so yeah.
