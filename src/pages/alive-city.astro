        The overall theme for this city is green, brutalist, modern, new,
        wooden, and glass. In different districts, there will be variation, we
        donâ€™t want the city to look boring and repetitive. We'll incorporate
        cabin, and classical styles here and there.

      <p class="body">
        Even the smallest little systems, and things required for running the
        city will be documented. Interesting little things, such as traffic
        light controllers as an example will be 3D modelled as an actual product
        and a user interface will be designed for them. Power, fluid,
        agriculture, etc, will all be documented. There will be a fully
        documented fusion power plant.
